{"content":{"0th":{"270":"A bison wrangler named Todd Trot tests a bison (blood samples taken, vaccinated). The main test is to check for the disease brucellosis. \n\n\n\nEvery year the bison herds inside Yellowstone National Park grow larger than the park can accomodate. Several hundred are usually culled by park officials who round them up to ship to slaughter, or by giving native Americans hunting rights along the park's boundary. An experimental program was tried where a small group (roughly 175?) were given to the Ted Turner ranch to hold during a long quarantine period. In the winter at the start of 2015 they were shipped to the Fort Peck Native Mawrican reservation as part of an experimental program to avoid the killing and to redistribute bison to natie people across the landscape.","274":1,"306":"2020:01:08 16:17:56","315":"David Guttenfelder","34665":904},"Exif":{"36864":"0231"},"GPS":{},"Interop":{},"1st":{},"thumbnail":null}}
